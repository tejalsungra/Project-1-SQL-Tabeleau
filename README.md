# Project-1-SQL-Tabeleau


This project is about a fictious e-commerce company Eniac in Europe , which is expanding its business in Brazil. Eniac mainly deals with the expensive tech products or apple compatible accesorries.
As Eniac is new to Brazillian markets, it is taking help from an centralized order management company in Brazil called Magist. However, Eniac has two major concerns where:

1. Is Magist a good fit for high-end tech products?
2. Are orders from Magist delivered on time?

To answer these questions, an analysis of Magist database has done using **SQL** which is represetned in the form of interactive **Tabeleau** dashboard and **powerpoint** slides.

All the code to reach the solution can be found on **magist_project_sol_vinita.sql** (https://github.com/tejalsungra/Project-1-SQL-Tabeleau/blob/main/magist_dump/magist_project_sol_vinita.sql)

The schema of the magist_dump can be found on **magist_schema.pdf** (https://github.com/tejalsungra/Project-1-SQL-Tabeleau/blob/main/magist_dump/magist_schema.pdf)

The magist dump can be found on **magist_dump.sql** (https://github.com/tejalsungra/Project-1-SQL-Tabeleau/blob/main/magist_dump/magist_dump.sql)

The conclusion for the two main concerns can be found on **2022-06-02-Group_4_Presentation_Zhanna_Borodaeva (1).pptx** (https://github.com/tejalsungra/Project-1-SQL-Tabeleau/blob/main/magist_dump/2022-06-02-Group_4_Presentation_Zhanna_Borodaeva%20(1).pptx)
